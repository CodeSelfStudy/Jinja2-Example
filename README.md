# Jinja2 Example in Python

This is a quick example of using Jinja2 (without Flask).

# The raw data is in a tab-delimited file in the `./data` directory.
# The Jinja template is in the './templates' directory.
# The script that combines them is `process_template.py`.
# If you want to generate different random data, edit the file in the `./data_generator` directory and run it to output a new data file.

## Info

* Make a Python 3 virtualenv.
